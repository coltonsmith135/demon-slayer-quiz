It is a quiz about the anime Demon Slayer

Provide a short description explaining the what, why, and how of your project. Use the following questions as a guide:

I love the anime Demon Slayer and would love for more people to learn about it. I think it has a lot of really interesting concepts and brings a lot of emotion and excitement to its viewer's.
I built this project because I thought it would be a fun way to see how much people know about Demon Slayer and to test their knowledge.

In doing this project i learned how to make elements appear and also hide after certain actions, as well as make properly working functions and set a timer on my webpage. I also learned how to create an array of objects and be able to pull them and randomize them as well.
